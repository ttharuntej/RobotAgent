******* If you want to play the robot by auto generated map then check the constants file (Constants.java) 	for path of autogenerated maze map. Place the help file in the path provided by HELP_FILE_LOCATION.




* The program is assumed to be implemented on correct input. Proper hints are provided while inputing.

* Help option is provided if you need any help.


* To generate a maze the minimum number of columns and rows should be greater than 3. Because if you give less than 3 then there will be only one dot(.) path postion.

* Candys in the auto maze are generated based on the dots(.). Less than half paths are filled with candys.

* Time Limit is calculated automatically by rows * columns(product of rows and columns).

* Code formatting is done by Eclipse IDE based on my system screen size. So it may differ from system to system.

* For generation of automode code is referenced from the following site.http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking
